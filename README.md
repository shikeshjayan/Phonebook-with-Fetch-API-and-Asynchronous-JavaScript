# PhoneBook App

A simple, responsive PhoneBook web application built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap 5. It allows users to add, view, search, edit, and delete contacts, with all data persisted to a mock REST API using MockAPI.io.

---

## Features

- Add new contacts with name and phone number using a clean form UI.
- View a list of all contacts fetched from a REST endpoint.
- Live search contacts by name or phone number.
- Edit existing contacts inline and save changes back to the API.
- Delete contacts with confirmation prompts and instant UI updates.
- User‑friendly empty states (e.g., when there are no contacts or no search results).
- Responsive design using Bootstrap 5 and Bootstrap Icons.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5** for markup.
- **CSS3** with custom styling and Bootstrap utility classes.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** for all client‑side logic and API communication. 
- **Bootstrap 5.3** for layout, components, and responsiveness.
- **Bootstrap Icons** for action icons (edit, delete, user, phonebook).
- **MockAPI.io** as a mock backend REST API for storing contacts.
